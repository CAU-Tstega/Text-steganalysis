# Text Steganalysis PyTorch 1.10

##### This repository contains a PyTorch reimplementation for previously prevailing text steganalysis methods based on Deep Learning. 

##### The metrics for these methods include Detection Accuracy (A), Recall (R), Precision (P), and F1-score (F1).

##### The codebase is heavily inspired by the [Pytorch implementation for text classification.](https://github.com/649453932/Chinese-Text-Classification-Pytorch)
